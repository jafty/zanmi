                        Hey, I'm Japhet :) Having lived in different cities and countries, I know how hard it can be to meet people and feel truly connected.

                    <p class="story-text">
                        That's why I started Zanmi (which means "friend" in Caribbean Creole) ‚Äî to create an easy, fun way to meet new people in Toulouse, without weird apps or forced meetups.

                        Now we host small hangouts designed to help locals and expats connect naturally, through shared experiences in a warm and welcoming setting.

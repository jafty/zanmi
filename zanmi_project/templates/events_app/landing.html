                        Salut, my name is Japhet :)

                    <p class="story-text">
                        As someone who's moved to different cities and countries, I know firsthand how challenging it can be to build meaningful connections in a new place. Traditional meetups often felt too big and impersonal, while one-on-one meetings could be awkward or intimidating.
                    </p>
                    <p class="story-text">
                        That's why I created Zanmi ‚Äì to provide a space where like-minded people from all over the world can meet naturally in Toulouse, without the awkwardness. Our small-group format and carefully planned activities create the perfect environment for genuine connections to flourish.
                    </p>
                    <p class="story-text">
                        <b style="color: var(--primary);">Zanmi means ‚Äòfriend‚Äô in Caribbean Creole.</b><br>I chose that name because it reminds me that this is about real connections ‚Äî not followers, not matches. And that's what we're up to: just good people meeting up.<br /><br />So whether you're a local looking to expand your international circle or a newcomer seeking to build authentic connections, Zanmi is designed to make meeting people feel natural, fun, and meaningful.
